# zod-tools

The main tool here is the Zod schema matcher. There is also the inspector, but itâ€™s mainly used as a component of the matcher.

The matcher emulates pattern matching, something found in other languages 

## Inspector

A handy wrapper around a `zod` schema node.

```typescript
import { zodInspector }
```
